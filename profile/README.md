# AI for Industry 4.0

Description of our repositories.

- **[tsad-benchmark](https://github.com/AII4-0/tsad-benchmark)** : Contains the Time Series Anomaly Detection toolkit named TSAD with a benchmarking protocol and state-of-the-art deep learning models. All models are implemented in PyTorch.

- **[TinyML-STM32](https://github.com/AII4-0/TinyML-STM32)** : Contains several projects for benchmarking TinyML on STM32 microcontrollers and x86-64. A Nucleo-F411RE and a Nucleo-H743ZI board are used to test the TinyML. The models tested come from [tsad-benchmark](https://github.com/AII4-0/tsad-benchmark).

- **[TinyML-VacuumPumps](https://github.com/AII4-0/TinyML-VacuumPumps)** : Contains a ML-app fpr predictive maintenance on Vacuum Pumps. There are various anomalies on vacuum pumps and the ML-app is able to detect them. In addition, the repo contains two STMCubeIDE projects used to deploy the ML-app on a STM32 microcontroller. One project is used to test the ML-app on the board with test data and the second project is used to detect anomalies directly on the vacuum pump in real time.

- **[aii4.0-pipeline](https://github.com/AII4-0/aii4.0-pipeline)** : Contains the implementation of a complete MLOps pipeline for the models of the [tsad-benchmark] repository.
